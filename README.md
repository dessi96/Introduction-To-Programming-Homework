Reformat the following C# code to make it readable according to the C# best practices for code formatting. Change the casing of the identifiers in the code (e.g. use PascalCase for the class name):
HorribleCode.cs
using

System;

class hoRRiblEcoDe
{
    static
     void

        Main()
    {
        Console.

    WriteLine("Hi, I am horribly formatted program"
); Console.
      WriteLine("Numbers and squares:")
; for (int i = 0;
i < 10;
i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(i +
                " --> " + i
                *
                i);
        }
    }
}
Problem 11.	Programming Languages
Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages. How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#?
